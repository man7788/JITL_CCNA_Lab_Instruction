# Day 25 Lab - EIGRP Configuration

## Step 2

View a concise summary of interface IP addresses and status.

```
# show ip interface brief
```

Create/configure a loopback interface.

```
(config)# interface loopback <number>
```

Set the interfaces's IP address/netmask.

```
(config-if)#ip address <ip-address> <netmask>
```

## Step 3

Create/configure an EIGRP process.

```
(config)# router eigrp <as-number>
```

Activate EIGRP on all interfaces.

```
(config-router)# network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
```

> Not recommended on real networks.

View information about router's active routing protocols.

```
# show ip protocols
```

Disable automatic network summarization.

```
(config-router)# no auto-summary
```

Configure a passive interface.

```
(config-router)# passive-interface <interface>
```

Activate EIGRP on interfaces with an IP address in the specified range.

```
(config-router)# network <ip-address> <wildcard-mask>
```

View EIGRP neighbors and their status.

```
# show ip eigrp neighbors
```

View the routing table.

```
# show ip route [protocol]
```

To display Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) topology table entries.

```
# show ip eigrp topology
```

## Step 4

View information about router's active routing protocols.

```
# show ip protocols
```

Instructs the router to include routes with a metric less than or equal to n times the minimum metric route for that destination, where n is the number specified by the variance command.

```
(config-router)# variance <n>
```
