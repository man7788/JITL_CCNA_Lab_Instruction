# Day 26 Lab - OSPF (Part 1)

## Step 2

Create/configure a loopback interface.

```
(config)# interface loopback <number>
```

Set the interfaces's IP address/netmask.

```
(config-if)# ip address <ip-address> <netmask>
```

View a concise summary of interface IP addresses and status.

```
# show ip interface brief
```

View interface Layer 1/2 information.

```
# show interfaces [interface]
```

## Step 3

Create/configure an OSPF process.

```
(config)# router ospf <process-id>
```

Activate OSPF on all interfaces.

```
(config-router)# network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area <area>
```

Configure a passive interface.

```
(config-router)# passive-interface <interface>
```

Activate OSPF on interfaces with an IP address in the specified range.

```
(config-router)# network <ip-address> <wildcard-mask> area <area>
```

> Different ways to config OSPF:
>1. Exact IP address with /32 prefix.
>2. Network address of all interfaces e.g. IP address with /16 prefix.
>3. Network address of individual interfaces e.g. IP address with /31 subnet prefix.

## Step 4

Advertise a default route to other routers.

```
(config-router)# default-information originate
```

Set the interfaces's IP address/netmask.

```
(config-if)#ip address <ip-address> <netmask>
```

View information about router's active routing protocols.

```
# show ip protocols
```

View the OSPF LSDB.

```
# show ip ospf database
```

View OSPF neighbors and their status.

```
# show ip ospf neighbor
```

View information about all OSPF interfaces/an OSPF interface.

```
# show ip ospf interface <interface>
```

## Step 5

View the routing table.

```
# show ip route
```
