# Day 28 Lab - OSPF (Part 3)

## Step 1

View a concise summary of interface IP addresses and status.

```
# show ip interface brief
```

Set the interfaces's IP address/netmask.

```
(config-if)# ip address <ip-address> <netmask>
```

Identify which side is DCE / DTE.

```
# show controllers <interface-id>
```

Configure the clock rate on the DCE side.

```
(config-if)# clock rate <bps>
```

Enable the interface.

```
(config-if)# no shutdown
```

View information about router's active routing protocols.

```
# show ip protocols
```

Activate OSPF on the interface.

```
(config-if)# ip ospf <process-id> area <area>
```

View information about an OSPF interface.

```
# show ip ospf interface <interface>
```

View the routing table.

```
# show ip route
```

## Step 2

View OSPF neighbors and their status.

```
# show ip ospf neighbor
```

View the routing table.

```
# show ip route
```

View information about an OSPF interface.

```
# show ip ospf interface <interface>
```

Set the interface's OSPF network type.

```
(config-if)# no ip ospf network point-to-point
```

### PC1's Command Prompt

Send Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo Request messages

```
> ping <targetname>
```

## Step 3

View OSPF neighbors and their status.

```
# show ip ospf neighbor
```

View information about an OSPF interface.

```
# show ip ospf interface <interface>
```

Set the interfaces's hello timer.

```
(config-if)# no ip ospf hello-interval
```

Set the interfaces's dead timer.

```
(config-if)# no ip ospf dead-interval
```

## Step 4

### PC1's Command Prompt

Send Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo Request messages.

```
> ping <targetname>
```

View the running-config.

```
# show running-config | section ospf
```

Set the interfaces's IP address/netmask.

```
(config-if)#ip address <ip-address> <netmask>
```

View the routing table.

```
# show ip route
```

## Step 5

View the OSPF LSDB.

```
# show ip ospf database
```
