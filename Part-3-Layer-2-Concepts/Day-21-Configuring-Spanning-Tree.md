    ```
    (config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
    ```

    Enable BPDU Guard on the port.

    ```
    (config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard enable
    ```

5.  Delete connection between SW3 and PC1.
6.  Connect SW3 to PC1 again, it should re-connect immediately.
7.  Delete connection between SW3 and PC1.
8.  Connect SW3 to SW4, SW3 should shut down.
9.  Delete connection between SW3 and SE4.
10. Connect SW3 to PC1 again.
11. Enable/disable the interface.
